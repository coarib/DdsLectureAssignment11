We will then damped those differences by differing decay factors and plot the effects of theose differences.\n\n```{r SNP_Analysis}\n# Unit 11: Modeling Financial Data\n# Uncomment and install packages if you don't have it\n#install.packages(\"tseries\")\n\n# Description: Please fill out that this is for educational purposes and talk about what it's for!\n\nlibrary(tseries)\n\n## S&P 500 (^GSPC)\n###    SNP - SNP Real Time Price. Currency in USD\n\n# DONE: Download the data of SP500 '^gspc'.\nSNPdata <- get.hist.quote('^gspc',quote=\"Close\")\n\n# DONE: Calculate the log returns, which is the subtraction of log(lag(SNPdata)) and log(SNPdata)\nSNPret <- log(lag(SNPdata))-log(SNPdata)\n\n# DONE: Calculate volatility measure that is to multiply sd(SNPret),sqrt(250), 100\nSNPvol <- sd(SNPret) * sqrt(250) * 100\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n## Plot of Results\nIn the plots below we will print the volatility with the three different decay factors and color the lines according the the decay factor used. Decay Factor 10 = BLACK, Decay Factor 30 = RED, Decay Factor 100 = BLUE \n\n```{r SNP_Analysis_Plot}\n\n## Define getVol function for volatility\ngetVol <- function(d, logrets) {\n\tvar = 0\n\tlam = 0\n\tvarlist <- c()\n\n\tfor (r in logrets) {\n\t\tlam = lam*(1 - 1/d) + 1\n\t  var = (1 - 1/lam)*var + (1/lam)*r^2\n\t\tvarlist <- c(varlist, var)\n\t}\n\n\tsqrt(varlist)\n}\n\n# Calculate volatility over entire length of series for various three different decay factors: 10 30. 100\n\n# DONE: call getVol function with the parameters: 10,SNPret\nvolest <- getVol(10,SNPret)\n\n# DONE: call getVol function with the parameters: 30,SNPret\nvolest2 <- getVol(30,SNPret)\n\n# DONE: call getVol function with the parameters: 100,SNPret\nvolest3 <- getVol(100,SNPret)\n# Plot the results, overlaying the volatility curves on the data, just as was done in the S&P example.\nplot(volest,type=\"l\")\n\n# DONE: Add connected line segments for volest2 with the parameters: type=\"l\",col=\"red\"\nlines(volest2,type=\"l\", col=\"red\")\n\n# DONE: Add connected line segments for volest3 with the parameters: type=\"l\",col=\"blue\"\nlines(volest3,type=\"l\", col=\"blue\")\n\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere were many peaks in the volatility measure of the data, with the largest peaking appearing at around index 4700.\nAs the decay factors got larger, the volatility measured in the data set appeared to me \"smoothed out\", the peaks were not as high, most notably around the largest peak.\n\n",
